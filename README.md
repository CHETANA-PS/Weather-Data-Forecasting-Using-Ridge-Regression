Mobile Phone Price Prediction

 Project Overview:
This project uses machine learning to predict mobile phone prices based on various features such as battery capacity, RAM, and screen size. The model is developed using Python and the **Linear Regression** algorithm.

Tools and Libraries:
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib,Seaborn for data visualization

Dataset:
The dataset contains over 1,000 data points with features like battery capacity, RAM, screen size, and more.

Steps:
1. Data cleaning and feature engineering.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Model training using Linear Regression.
4. Accuracy of the model: 85%.
