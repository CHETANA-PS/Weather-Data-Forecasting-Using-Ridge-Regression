Weather-Data-Forecasting-Using-Ridge-Regression

"Weather data forecasting using Ridge Regression to predict maximum temperatures based on historical weather data. The model improves forecast accuracy by 15% through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation."

 Project Overview:
This project uses Ridge Regression to predict the maximum temperature based on historical weather data. The model improves forecast accuracy by 15% by performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

 Tools and Libraries:
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning (Ridge Regression)

 Dataset:
The dataset consists of 5 years of historical weather data, including features like date, temperature, and weather conditions.

Steps:
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
2. Model training using Ridge Regression.
3. Model evaluation and accuracy improvement.

 Outcome:
Achieved a 15% improvement in forecast accuracy for predicting maximum temperatures based on historical data.
